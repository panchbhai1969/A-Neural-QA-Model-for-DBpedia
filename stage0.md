# End of Community Bonding Period: The Literature Survey  

>> <p align="center">Learn from what has already been done.</p>

The community bonding period is fast coming to an end, what better way to asses it rather than reflecting upon what I proposed to do in this period. By the way I didn't share the link to my proposal, click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jEPgQyLm7L_Ll1JuCXy8zg2T39VlP70XAmh4I-NVBU/edit?usp=sharing) to check it out. 

Moving back to the discussion, here we go. These are the points I was supposed to cover during the *Community Bonding Period*:

- Get to know the mentors and the community: listen, communicate and learn.
- Learn about the intricacies of the coding practices followed by DBpedia, which
include coding, community relations as well as version control practices.
- Go through research paper on the relevant field to come up with good
strategies to handle the problems at hand. (Learn from what has already been
done in this field).
- Understand the people you are working with, finalize all required channels of communication.
- Understand the current code base in detail, ponder upon all possible improvements and discuss with the mentors.

Lets go over each pint one by one:

### Get to know the mentors and the community: listen, communicate and learn.

The work that i did as part of the task is as follows:

- I initialted the channels of communication with my mentors by creating a private channel in Slack. That is the place where all discussion regarding the project happens. (A mail was sent to the mentors regarding the same by me.)

- The first meeting was organized by one of the mentors, susequest one were created as a recussing event to be held every Monday till the end of GSoC period.

- The menotrs put forward some very important points during the first meeting that i intend to follow during the rest of the GSOC period.

### Learn about the intricacies of the coding practices followed by DBpedia, which include coding, community relations as well as version control practices.

- Methods of collaborating was discussed in the last blog ([Week Two](https://anandpanchbhai.com/A-Neural-QA-Model-for-DBpedia/WeekTwo.html)) you can know more about it by going to the previous blog.

- No other aspects where explicity discussed.

### Go through research paper on the relevant field to come up with good strategies to handle the problems at hand. (Learn from what has already been done in this field).

This task ended up using the most amount of time in the 3rd week of community bonding. I read through many the research papers related to my project, here are a few: 

1. LC-QuAD: A Corpus for Complex Question Answering
over Knowledge Graphs: http://lc-quad.sda.tech/

2. WDAqua-core1: A Question Answering service for RDF Knowledge Bases: https://doi.org/10.1145/3184558.3191541:

3. Seq2SQL: Generating Structured Queries from
Natural Language using Reinforcement Learning: https://einstein.ai/static/images/pages/research/seq2sql/seq2sql.pdf

>> Section will be improved soon

### Understand the people you are working with, finalize all required channels of communications.

- As per the first point

### Understand the current code base in detail, ponder upon all possible improvements and discuss with the mentors.

- I went through the whole code and commented a lots of part of the code to increase my understanding of the code.

- Few improvements were done like the issues i created as per the Week Two blog.



>> All the tasks assigned to be done in the community bonding period were done on time.
