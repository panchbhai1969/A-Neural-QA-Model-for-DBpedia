The impact I can make because of GSoC :The most important part being able to add your bit to the journey of great organisations like DBpedia in their endeavour to make information accessible to everyone. The project I work on is going to make a difference to every aspect of information retrieval from Linked data by humans. To such an extent that accessing data will be reminiscent to talking in your natural language to a simple device. 

Contributing to an open source Project: I remember my hands were trembling with a lot of questions in my mind before i made my first pull request to DBpedia, the thrill and respect i have in mind for such massive open source organisations in huge. I feel privileged to be able to add another drop of water to this ocean of lines of codes that possess the ability to bring change.

Meeting brilliant people from across the globe: the mentors are really good. We have limited communication but the communication we manage to have is very fruitful. They are very knowledgeable and patient. 

The immutability: I am still sometimes awe struck by the fact that the commit and pull requests that I make which when gets accepted and merged are gonna be there till eternity(Usually). This feeling fills me with a joy something like an immortality project.

I thank Google for making this program possible, and connecting people like me to beautiful organisations  like Dbpedia.


Finding the organisation: that's the most challenging part, you gotta sit and profile and shortlist based on your interests. 

Observe the shortlisted ones as the contributing developer evolve the code by keeping track of the conversations in the IRC and chat groups.

Understanding the codebase (usually only a part) of the participating organisations and then proposing ideas. And fixing bugs

 Carefully observing the competition on the comment section . And ever evolving your proposal  so that it is always ahead of the curve. 

Being honest!
